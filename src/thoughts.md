away from the cyberdeck thoughts
- new variable in tools to handle formatting chunks, allow me to use "thoughts: " or more accurate file info based on tool settings

- refactor 'Resources' as class similar to how Tools, Agents and Tasks are setup. 

Agents->Tasks-->Tools-->Resources
is the core system and graph inherency.

- Add user feedback interrupt tool, initially similate this with a "simulated user" agent, but make it flexible for deployment.

- focus on "emulating" a agentic pipeline for datagen into sharegpt schema.

- refocus my embedding and data injest to be more chaotic for good diverse inter domain data gen. focus on building smol solutions for local based on existing api intercepts for easy swapping out the local lattice for a money burning corpo one for future scale. letting us foxus big dog energy on the more sensitive nodes in the flowgraph.

After analyzing your agentic graph flow pipeline, I can see that you have a well-structured and modular design. Let me break down the key components and their relationships:

1. Core Abstractions:
   - `TextChunker`: Utility class for chunking text into smaller pieces.
   - `TextCleaner`: Tool for cleaning and parsing text from HTML and PDFs.
   - `WikipediaSearchTool`, `SemanticFileSearchTool`, `TextReaderTool`, `WebScraperTool`, `NERExtractionTool`, `SemanticAnalysisTool`: Various tools for reading text, scraping web content, extracting named entities, and performing sentiment analysis.
   - `UserFeedbackTool`: Tool for requesting user feedback.
   - `Agent`: Class for defining agents with their roles, goals, tools, and other attributes.
   - `Task`: Class for defining tasks with instructions, expected output, associated agents, context, and other attributes.
   - `Squad`: Class for organizing and running a group of agents and tasks.

2. Structure:
   - The `Agent` class represents individual agents with specific roles, goals, tools, and personas.
   - The `Task` class represents tasks that agents can perform, with instructions, expected output, and associated context.
   - The `Squad` class orchestrates the execution of tasks by agents, handling context passing and logging.

3. Flow:
   - The `mainflow()` function sets up the resources, tools, agents, and tasks.
   - It defines the relationships between agents and tasks, creating a graph-like structure.
   - The `Squad` instance is created with the agents and tasks, defining the flow of the pipeline.
   - The `run()` method of the `Squad` class executes the tasks in the defined order, passing context between tasks and agents.

4. Resources and Tools:
   - Resources like text documents, PDFs, and web pages are used as inputs to the tools.
   - Tools like `TextReaderTool`, `WebScraperTool`, and `SemanticFileSearchTool` process the resources and provide functionality to the agents.

Your idea of introducing a new `Resources` class to handle raw data like text, PDFs, Markdown, and websites is a great way to further modularize and organize the pipeline. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Create a `Resources` class with a similar structure to the existing core abstraction classes.
2. The `Resources` class can have methods for loading and preprocessing different types of raw data.
3. Modify the existing tools to accept instances of the `Resources` class instead of directly handling file paths or URLs.
4. Update the `mainflow()` function to create instances of the `Resources` class for each raw data source and pass them to the appropriate tools.

By introducing the `Resources` class, you can centralize the handling of raw data and make the tools more focused on their specific functionalities. This will improve the modularity and maintainability of your pipeline.

Additionally, you can consider the following enhancements:

- Add error handling and validation in the `Resources` class to handle invalid or missing data gracefully.
- Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant processing of resources.
- Explore ways to parallelize the processing of resources to improve performance.

Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like to discuss the implementation of the `Resources` class in more detail.
Based on your existing code layout and the Agent > Task > Tool > Resources inheritance paradigm, here's how you can introduce the `Resources` class:

```python
class Resources:
    def __init__(self, resource_type: str, resource_path: str):
        self.resource_type = resource_type
        self.resource_path = resource_path
        self.data = self.load_resource()

    def load_resource(self):
        if self.resource_type == 'text':
            return self.load_text()
        elif self.resource_type == 'pdf':
            return self.load_pdf()
        elif self.resource_type == 'web':
            return self.load_web()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported resource type: {self.resource_type}")

    def load_text(self):
        with open(self.resource_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()

    def load_pdf(self):
        with open(self.resource_path, 'rb') as file:
            pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
            text = ""
            for page in pdf_reader.pages:
                text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
            return text

    def load_web(self):
        response = requests.get(self.resource_path)
        return response.text
```

In this implementation:
- The `Resources` class is initialized with a `resource_type` (e.g., 'text', 'pdf', 'web') and a `resource_path` (file path or URL).
- The `load_resource()` method is called during initialization to load the resource data based on the resource type.
- The `load_text()`, `load_pdf()`, and `load_web()` methods handle the specific loading logic for each resource type.
- The loaded resource data is stored in the `data` attribute of the `Resources` instance.

Next, update the existing tools to accept instances of the `Resources` class:

```python
class TextReaderTool:
    def __init__(self, resource: Resources, chunk_size: int, num_chunks: int):
        self.resource = resource
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.num_chunks = num_chunks

    def read_text(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        chunker = TextChunker(self.resource.data, self.chunk_size, overlap=0)
        chunks = chunker.chunk_text()
        return chunks[:self.num_chunks]
```

Similarly, update the other tools (`WebScraperTool`, `SemanticFileSearchTool`, etc.) to accept `Resources` instances instead of directly handling file paths or URLs.

Finally, modify the `mainflow()` function to create instances of the `Resources` class and pass them to the tools:

```python
def mainflow():
    text_resource = Resources('text', "inputs/cyberanimism_clean.txt")
    pdf_resource = Resources('pdf', "inputs/book1.pdf")
    web_resource = Resources('web', "http://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/mplot3d/2dcollections3d.html#sphx-glr-gallery-mplot3d-2dcollections3d-py")

    text_reader_tool = TextReaderTool(text_resource, chunk_size=1000, num_chunks=5)
    web_scraper_tool = WebScraperTool(web_resource, chunk_size=512, num_chunks=2)
    # ...

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With these changes, the `Resources` class is now integrated into your agentic graph flow pipeline. The tools receive `Resources` instances, which handle the loading and preprocessing of raw data. This improves the modularity and maintainability of your pipeline by separating the resource handling logic from the tools and agents.

Absolutely! Let's enhance the `Resources` class to handle string templates for contextualizing chunks and include additional metadata such as file information, location, and start/end positions of chunks. Here's how you can modify the `Resources` class:

```python
class Resources:
    def __init__(self, resource_type: str, resource_path: str, context_template: str = None):
        self.resource_type = resource_type
        self.resource_path = resource_path
        self.context_template = context_template
        self.data = self.load_resource()
        self.chunks = []

    def load_resource(self):
        # ... (same as before)

    def load_text(self):
        # ... (same as before)

    def load_pdf(self):
        # ... (same as before)

    def load_web(self):
        # ... (same as before)

    def chunk_resource(self, chunk_size: int, overlap: int = 0):
        chunker = TextChunker(self.data, chunk_size, overlap)
        self.chunks = chunker.chunk_text()

    def contextualize_chunk(self, chunk: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        if self.context_template:
            return self.context_template.format(
                chunk=chunk['text'],
                file=self.resource_path,
                start=chunk['start'],
                end=chunk['end']
            )
        else:
            return chunk['text']
```

In this updated implementation:
- The `Resources` class now accepts an optional `context_template` parameter during initialization. This template string can include placeholders for chunk text, file information, and start/end positions.
- The `chunk_resource()` method is added to chunk the loaded resource data using the `TextChunker` class. The resulting chunks are stored in the `chunks` attribute of the `Resources` instance.
- The `contextualize_chunk()` method takes a chunk dictionary and returns a contextualized string based on the provided `context_template`. If no template is provided, it simply returns the chunk text.

Now, let's update the `TextReaderTool` to utilize the new methods of the `Resources` class:

```python
class TextReaderTool:
    def __init__(self, resource: Resources, chunk_size: int, num_chunks: int):
        self.resource = resource
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.num_chunks = num_chunks

    def read_text(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        self.resource.chunk_resource(self.chunk_size)
        contextualized_chunks = [
            {
                'text': self.resource.contextualize_chunk(chunk),
                'start': chunk['start'],
                'end': chunk['end'],
                'file': self.resource.resource_path
            }
            for chunk in self.resource.chunks[:self.num_chunks]
        ]
        return contextualized_chunks
```

In the updated `TextReaderTool`:
- The `read_text()` method now calls the `chunk_resource()` method of the `Resources` instance to chunk the loaded resource data.
- It then contextualizes each chunk using the `contextualize_chunk()` method and includes additional metadata such as start/end positions and file information in the resulting chunk dictionaries.

Finally, you can update the `mainflow()` function to provide context templates when creating `Resources` instances:

```python
def mainflow():
    text_resource = Resources('text', "inputs/cyberanimism_clean.txt", "Here are your thoughts on the statement '{chunk}' from the file '{file}' (start: {start}, end: {end}): ")
    # ...

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With these modifications, the `Resources` class now handles string templates for contextualizing chunks, and the resulting chunk dictionaries include additional metadata such as file information and start/end positions. This modularizes the
